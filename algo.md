[8,9]
[,8], [10,] (equivalent to standard or ie9)
[,8], [9,]
	i.e., if neg and lower = upper + 1 then equiv to -ie


# merge

-ie and ie[range?] ==> impossible
-ie[range] and ie[range?] ==> invert neg and merge

intersect the ranges


-[8,9] merged with ie becomes 2 separate statements: ie<=7 OR ie>=10
	ie -ie[8,9]

- can't subtract a closed range

## inversion
-[8,9] becomes
